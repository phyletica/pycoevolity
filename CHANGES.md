Version 0.1.2
=============

Changes
-------

-   Adding CLI option to specify colors for plotting the comparison of
    divergence-time densities.

-   Adding '--charsets' option to include include a 'sets' block that defines
    locus boundaries in output nexus files.

-   Adding CLI tools for converting fasta files (rather than just .loci files
    from iPyrad). There is now a fastas2alignment tool, which converts a bunch
    of fastas into a concatenated nexus or phylip file, and a fastas2 fastas
    tool which 'normalizes' a bunch of fasta files such that they all have the
    same set of sequences.
